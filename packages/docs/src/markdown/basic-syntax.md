# Basic Syntax

With ZeDocs you will be using Markdown to write your documentation. Markdown is
a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax.

This page will go over the basics of how to author Markdown files as well as
the basic syntax.

## Markdown files

Markdown files are text files with an extension of `.md`. You can use any text
editor to open and edit Markdown files.

Here is an example of a file called `hello.md`:

```
# Hello world

This is my *first* document!
```

## Inline markup

With Markdown you are able to style your text inline.

| You write | Alternative | You see |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `*italic*` | `_italic_` | *italic* |
| `**bold**` | `__bold__` | **bold** |
| `***both***` | `___both___` | ***both*** |
| `~~strike~~` | | ~~strike~~ |
| `_hey **nested**_` | | _hey **nested**_ |
